/**
 * THE MESSAGE LIST, and its five states.
 *
 * Each state is a separate answer, not a fallback: a room with nothing in it,
 * a room still being read and a room that could not be read all render an empty
 * column if the phase is thrown away, and the three are then indistinguishable
 * to a reader and to anything scoring the screen. The read carries the phase
 * and this is where it is spent.
 *
 * The list is anchored to its END, because a conversation is read from the
 * bottom. That is one `justify` on the scroller's content rather than a
 * scroll-to-bottom effect: an effect fights the reader who has scrolled up, and
 * it runs one frame late, so the first paint of every room is its middle.
