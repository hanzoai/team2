/**
 * The chat reads, as the screens ask for them.
 *
 * Every one answers a PHASE, because a screen that renders rows from an empty
 * array looks identical whether the room has nothing in it, the socket has not
 * answered yet, or the read failed — and a screen scored from whichever of
 * those happened to render is a screen scored from nothing. `data/query.ts`
 * carries the phase; this layer only decides the keys and re-reads on a push.
 *
 * The keys are namespaced by room so a broadcast can drop one room's messages
 * without dropping the roster or the sidebar.
