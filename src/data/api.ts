/**
 * The addresses this client states for itself, and the one place an API host
 * appears.
 *
 * In development the origin is EMPTY and every call is relative, because the
 * dev server proxies `/v1` — which is also what makes the issuer's credential
 * exchange same-origin on a loopback host the issuer will not answer to. A
 * published build is served from the site plane rather than from behind the
 * gateway, so it names the one endpoint. The credential is a bearer token, so
 * the call carries no cookie and needs no credentialed CORS.
 *
 * What can never be relative is the ISSUER's two full-page trips: the browser
 * leaves, so neither of them is a request.
