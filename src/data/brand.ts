/**
 * WHICH product this is, decided by the host.
 *
 * One image serves every host it is published on, so none of this may be
 * compiled in. A build-time variable pins the deployment to whichever brand
 * happened to build it, and a second host then sends its visitors to the first
 * one's issuer carrying a `redirect_uri` that issuer has never heard of — an
 * error page in front of a perfectly healthy server.
 *
 * Deriving the org from the hostname is not enough either: the label left of the
 * suffix is `team2`, the organization is `hanzo`, and the issuer is neither. So
 * each brand states its own facts and the hosts it answers on, and a new brand
 * is a new record and nothing else.
