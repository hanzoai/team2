/**
 * How a request leaves this app, and there is one way.
 *
 * The bearer is the IAM access token and nothing else. No cookie is asked for
 * and none is sent: the team subsystem accepts an IAM access token on every
 * surface this app touches, so a second credential would be a second thing to
 * expire, refresh and get wrong. The org is NOT carried — `X-Org-Id` is
 * stripped on ingress and the tenant is read from the token's signed
 * membership set, which is the only reason a client cannot name someone else's
 * space.
 *
 * Addresses are relative. The dev server proxies `/v1`, a published build is
 * served from a host the gateway already fronts, and so no module here learns
 * an API host.
