/**
 * Who this browser is, decided once, in one place.
 *
 * This is the only module besides `iam.ts` that touches identity, and `iam.ts`
 * is the only one that imports @hanzo/iam. Everything else asks `useSession`
 * who the visitor is, or asks `http.call` to carry them — so there is exactly
 * one place a credential is obtained, refreshed or thrown away, and a second
 * one cannot appear without moving that import.
 *
 * Nothing here is custom auth. Every verb below is a call into @hanzo/iam,
 * which owns the PKCE round trip, the token store and the refresh. There is no
 * password check, no session of our own, no cookie we mint, and no second gate.
 *
 * Two ways in, and both end at the same exchange:
 *
 *   in place   `enter(name, secret)` posts the credential to IAM's login
 *              endpoint, which answers with a PKCE-BOUND authorization code on
 *              this app's own callback URL. `handleCallback(url)` then performs
 *              the ordinary RFC 7636 exchange against it. The password never
 *              reaches the token endpoint and the window never leaves.
 *   redirect   `depart()` hands the whole browser to the issuer. This is what
 *              runs when somebody would rather sign in at hanzo.id, and it is
 *              the fallback if the embedded endpoint is ever unavailable.
