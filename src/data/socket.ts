/**
 * The space's data plane: one socket, and everything rides it.
 *
 * Reads, writes and other people's writes are the same connection. A frame is
 * a ZAP envelope (`zap.ts`) carrying one JSON-RPC message; a reply is
 * correlated by id, and a broadcast arrives with no id at all as
 * `{"result":[…txes]}` — which is exactly the shape a write's own reply
 * produces, so a card MOVED BY THIS BROWSER and a card moved by somebody else
 * reach the screen through the same line of code. That is deliberate: an
 * optimistic local patch beside a push is two implementations of one fact, and
 * they disagree the first time a write is refused.
 *
 * The credential is the space token, and it lives in the URL PATH. It is
 * bearer-equivalent, sitting somewhere proxies and access logs record, which is
 * why the server gives it twelve hours and why reconnecting takes a fresh one
 * rather than replaying the old.
