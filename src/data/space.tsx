 * tenant is read on the server from the token's signed membership set. What
 * the client holds is the org that came BACK with a space — `SpaceRow.org` —
 * so choosing a space is how a person changes org, and there is no second way
 * to do it. Somebody in two orgs sees both orgs' spaces in one list, and the
 * one they open decides who they are acting as.
 *
 * The plane belongs here for the same reason: one space, one socket, and a
 * space change tears the old one down before the new one opens.
