/**

 * Every number here is image-derived from the reference at 2048×1138 and

 * comments so a later measurement can check the arithmetic instead of repeating
 * it. Where the reference states a rhythm the 4px ramp does not carry, the
 * measured value stands.
 *
 * The dot lane is REAL SPACE rather than an overlay, and that is measured, not
 * assumed: read rows wrap at the same width as unread ones, so the text column
 * is 214 whether a dot is drawn in it or not. Overlaying the dot would have let
 * a read row run 17px wider, and the two would have wrapped differently.

          RelativeTime keeps its own clock and re-renders only itself, so an
          open panel stays honest without the list re-rendering. It types its
          props as `<time>`'s, so the type role comes from the text host around
          it and `inherit` is what carries it down.

          `short` rather than `auto`, and it is a measurement not a taste: the
          reference writes "10 min ago", the published component's `auto` writes
          "10 minutes ago", and at this size that is 213 of the 214 the column
          has — so the project name beside it truncated. `short` writes "10m",
          which fits with room and says the same thing. Elapsed wording belongs
          to the component for the whole estate, so the choice is which of its
          forms to ask for and never a fourth one written here. */}
