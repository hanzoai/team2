 * `notification:*` objects, and every one of those arrives over the transactor
 * socket. So this region states the shape it needs (`note.ts`) and takes it
 * from a `Source`. Fixtures satisfy that interface today; whoever lands the
 * transactor client satisfies it with one call to `serve`, and nothing else in
 * this region moves.
 *
 * Live arrivals are a `KindPush` on that same socket: a source that has one
 * calls `arrive`. Nothing here polls.
