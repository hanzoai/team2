 * The door, and there is one.
 *
 * A product that reads a person's own work cannot be entered by a stranger, so
 * the whole tree sits behind this rather than each screen checking for itself —
 * a check per screen is a check a new screen forgets, and the screen it forgets
 * on is the one that renders somebody else's board.
 *
 * It answers the callback address HERE, above the router, because that renders
 * while the browser still has no identity and every route below expects one.
 * And `unknown` draws neither door: a flash of the sign-in screen in front of
 * somebody who is already signed in is worse than a moment of nothing.
 *
 * `?state=` opens it, because a fixture stands in for the whole plane and a
 * session is part of the plane. That is what makes a deterministic capture of
 * any screen possible without a credential — and it is the SAME knob, not a
 * second one: a build that could be entered another way would be a way in.
