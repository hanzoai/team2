/**
 * THE FOUR REGIONS.
 *
 *   rail        84   fixed, at every width
 *   navigator  208   fixed, dragged, a drawer when there is no room
 *   main         —   the ONLY fluid region: it absorbs every change of width and
 *                    scrolls its columns rather than reflowing them
 *   aside      308   fixed, dismissible, over main when there is no room
 *
 * Three fixed and one fluid is a FLEX layout, not a percentage split — a
 * percentage navigator grows with the window and the reference's does not. That
 * is why this does not reach for `ResizablePanelGroup`, whose panels are shares
 * of the whole; the one thing it would have brought is a drag, which is `Grip`
 * below and is twenty lines.
 *
 * The two raised panels float on the ground with one seam between them and the
 * same seam around them. The reference draws three widths there (8, 16, 20); one
 * value here, because a seam with three widths is three seams.
 *
 * WIDTH IS THIS ELEMENT'S, NOT THE WINDOW'S. What a region has to fit in is the
 * shell's width, which a desktop can make smaller than the viewport and which a
 * media query cannot see. `onLayout` is the measurement and the window is only
 * the seed, so the first paint is not one frame of the wrong layout.
