/**
 * WHAT THE PRODUCT CONTAINS. One table, and it is the only one.
 *
 * A surface is a top-level area: the rail switches between them and each owns a
 * root address. Adding one is an entry here and nothing else — the rail reads
 * this list and so does `routes.tsx`, so a surface cannot be reachable from the
 * rail and missing from the router, which is how a product ends up with a glyph
 * that goes nowhere.
 *
 * What is NOT a surface: the aside. It coexists with every screen rather than
 * being a place you go, so it has no address and no slot of its own — the bell
 * toggles it.
 *
 * The order is the rail's, and it is the reference's: calendar, chat, tracker,
 * time, meet, with the bell above them and the add control below.
